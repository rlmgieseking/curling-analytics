    html += '<p>In curling, two teams of four players take turns sliding rocks down a sheet of ice toward a target painted on the far end of the ice (called the <b>house</b> or <b>rings</b>), sweeping the ice in from of the rock to control its path. Each match has series of scoring opportunities called <b>ends</b> (similar to innings in baseball), typically 8 or 10 ends, and the team with the most points at the conclusion of the match wins. Unlike most sports, teams often concede early if they are too far behind to have a realistic chance of winning.</p>'
    html += '<p>In each end, the teams take turns sliding rocks until each team has delivered 8 rocks. The team that delivers the last rock (called <b>hammer</b>) has a big advantage in scoring, since they have the last chance to rearrange rocks to maximize their score.</p>'
    html += '<p>The score for the end is based on the placement of the rocks after all rocks are delivered. If no rocks are in the house, both teams score zero points. If at least one rock is touching the house, the team with the rock closest to the center of the rings scores one point for each of their rocks that is closer to the center than the nearest opponent rock. For example, if the closest rock to the center is red and the second closest is yellow, red scores 1 point. If the closest three rocks to the center are all yellow and the fourth closest is red, then yellow scores 3 points.</p>'

   <li>A final score is available, but no line score is available (~1700 matches).</li>
   <li>Scores are only reported in one or two ends (~1400 matches). While it is possible for one team to concede early in a match, visual inspection suggests that the majority of these matches had the end scores entered as placeholders, not as the actual scores of the first one or two ends.</li>
   <li>The final score is a tie (~150 matches). In most events, the match continues until a tie is broken, so these are most likely data entry errors.</li>

Since none of those features are stored permanently in matches, they need to be computed by joining with other tables.

  <li>Across the full database, the most common final scores are 6-5 for 8-end matches and 7-6 for 10-end matches.</li>
  <li>Low-scoring matches (fewer than 5 total points scored) are very rare. If one team has a very low-scoring game (0-2 points), it usually means the other team has a fairly high-scoring game (5-10 points). Even though blank ends are not extremely rare, it is rare for teams to blank most of the ends in a match.</li>
  <li>It is fairly rare for a team to score more than 9 points in an 8-end game, or more than 11 points in a 10-end game. There are several reasons for this:
      <ul>
        <li>Scores of more than 2-3 points in one end are fairly rare, so it is rare for the total number of points scored to be much more than twice the number of ends.</li>
        <li>Win margin is not used in any common curling statistics or ranking, so teams that are far ahead often play conservatively, aiming to maintain their margin but not take risks to increase it.</li>
        <li>Teams usually concede if they are so far behind that they do not have a realistic chance of winning, so a lopsided match will often end early before the winning team has a chance to build up a higher score.</li>

  <li>If the ranges of ranks for Team 1 and Team 2 are the same, the score distribution is of course symmetric across the diagonal. </li>

    # Main text 
    html += '<p>In high-level curling, most players and commentators think that having the advantage of hammer (last rock) in even ends is a big advantage late in the game. The team with hammer has more control over the outcome of the end and is much more likely to score. </p>'
    html += '<p>For example, a team that is down 2 points with hammer in end 8 of 10 could score 2 in end 8 (tieing the score), force their opponent to score 1 point in end 9 (going down by one), and then score 2 in end 10 to win by 1 point. In contrast, a team that is down by even 1 point without hammer in end 8 of 10 has a trickier route to winning the game: they need to either score 3 points when they have hammer or steal at least 1 point to have a chance of winning.</p>'
    html += '<p>The graph below shows the probability of Team 1 winning a curling match, and can be filtered by mens/womens, match length in ends, and ranks of the two teams. Positive margins mean that Team 1 is ahead, and negative margins means that Team 1 is behind.</p>'
    html += graphs.win_probability(c, season, combos, js, win_probs)
    html += '<p>This graph shows the following trends:</p>'
    html += '''<ul>
   <li>If the range of ranks is the same for Team 1 and Team 2, the left and right graphs essentially mirror each other (because both graphs use Team 1's points margin on the x axis), with their color scales reversed (because the color scale shows Team 1's chance of winning in both graphs).</li>
   <li>Situations that are impossible or have not occurred in any actual games in the database are shown as white boxes. For example, during End 1, no one has had an opportunity to score, so the only possible points margin is 0. The team that scores in End 1 loses hammer in End 2, so a positive margin (Team 1 scored) must mean that Team 2 has hammer and vice versa. An extra end (End 9 in an 8-end match, or End 11 in a 10-end match) only happens if the match is tied at the end of regular play.</li>
   <li>Some of the graphs, especially the ones sorted by team rank, have very few matches within certain ranges of margins - especially for margins where the lower-ranked team is ahead. The small sample size creates a lot of noise in the win probabilities, so the exact percentages should not be over-interpreted. You can hover the mouse over a box in the graph to see how many matches in the database fit that situation.</li>
   <li>There are fewer 10-end matches than 8-end matches in the database, and fewer women's matches than men's matches. I will focus mostly on 8-end men's games, since the larger number means that subset is the least noisy.</li>
   <li>If Team 1 and Team 2 have similar ranks:
       <ul><li>As expected, the team that is currently ahead on the scoreboard has a >50% chance of winning, and if the game is tied, the team with hammer has a >50% chance of winning.</li>
       <li>Even relatively small deficits on the scoreboard are hard to overcome in curling: a team up by 1 or more points with hammer has >70% chance of winning in almost all scenarios, and a team down by 2 or more points with hammer has a <30% chance of winning. This is not surprising because scores of >2 points in an end are fairly rare.</li>
       <li>For a given score margin, the fewer ends remain, the more likely it is that the team currently ahead on the scoreboard will go on to win the game in most cases (the colors generally get darker as you go up in the plot toward higher current end numbers).</li>
   </ul>
   <li>If Team 1 outranks Team 2:
       <ul><li>The higher-ranked team has a higher chance of winning even if they are not currently ahead. For example, for men's 8-end games where Team 1 is ranked 1-25 and Team 2 is ranked 101-500, Team 1 has a >50% chance of winning if they are down 1 point with hammer, or tied without hammer in End 7 or earlier.</li>
       <li>This suggests that even if a higher-ranked team makes a mistake early in a match to put themselves at a disadvantage, they are more likely to outplay their opponent later in the match and regain the advantage.</li>
   </ul>
   <li>Does the common wisdom match the data?
       <ul><li>If having hammer in even ends is actually a big advantage, I would expect the likelihood of Team 1 winning when they have hammer at a given score margin to be noticeably higher in End 6 of an 8-end match (of End 8 of a 10-end match) than in the surrounding ends.</li>
       <li>For teams of all ranks, that pattern is <b>not</b> clearly present: the probability of winning based on a given scenario in End 6 is not significantly different than during the nearby ends. This means that <b>the common wisdom is not quite accurate.</b></li>
       <li>Instead, for a team that is down 1-2 points with hammer, their odds of winning are a few percentage points lower in End 7 than in End 6 or 8 of an 8-end match. Instead of having hammer in even ends being an advantage, <b>having hammer in the next-to-last end is a small disadvantage in close matches.</b> Aiming to have hammer in even ends helps teams avoid this disadvantage, instead of giving them a direct advantage.</li>
       <li>Looking only at the top-ranked teams, there are hints that <b>the common wisdom may be more accurate for the best teams.</b> However, the data is sparse enough that these hints may just be noise.</li>
